# Loadbalancer-in-go

#### Implemented a loadbalancer from scratch that distributes the traffic on multiple hosted servers for the upcoming requests in a round-robin fashion.

#### It also does a health check on reular intervals, such that in case of any servers downtime the traffic is redirected to running servers.
